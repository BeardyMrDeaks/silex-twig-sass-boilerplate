#Sam Deacon - potfolio website based on:
# SILEX BOILERPLATE - cloud9

### Basic websites built with the silex php microframework, using sass and 3rd party composer packages, and symfony dependancies such as twig templating, and UrlGeneratorServiceProvider.

*Work in progress*

##TO use
1. fork/download from github
2. (assuming you have it installed) run composer update
3. **SASS (easy setup, if you have a gulp workflow ignore this):**
>   $ gem install sass
>   $ cd web/assets
>   $ sass --watch scss/:css/
>   * configure sass reference as in http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html*
4.  If you have issues loading assets (css etc) you may need to adjust the .htaccess file or move it within your web/ directory


*This is work in progress so if you would like to contact me about improvements I won't be offended!*
