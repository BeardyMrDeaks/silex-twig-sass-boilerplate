## issues / bad points with using c9 (ACE?) text editor
1. curly braces autocomplete - { requires return key to aut complete }, but should output {}
2. language specific - eg twig
..* '{%' should yield '{% %}'
..* block->TAB should yield {% block %} {% endblock %}
3. duplicate file *OH SWEET GOD WHY DO THEY DO THIS*
..* duplicate file: 'index.php' yield 'index.1.php' --> _WTF??_
..* in any other text editor duplicating a file ('index.php') would yield 'index.php' with 'index' highlighted so that you can change the file name striaght away
4. losing syntax
..* entering 
5. code snippets
..* there is no way to create custom code snippets, code snippets provided aren't adequat, massive fail
6. gulp browsersync --> this is really hard to get working with one port (8080), I will get it to work one day, but I just wished there was an easy answer to get browsersync/livereload working without having to trawl stackoverflow _and_ filter for cloud IDEs
7. testing out serverside emailing, this doesn't seem to work, Brady has posted one point relating to using gMail --> would be nice to have a step by step guide or at least pointing us in the right direction
